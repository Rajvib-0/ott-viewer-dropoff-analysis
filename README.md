This capstone project for Winter Consulting 2025 (Consulting &amp; Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati) analyzes viewer drop-off in OTT platforms using data from over 33,000 episodes. The goal is to identify key drivers of retention, segment content via clustering, and propose ML-driven interventions to reduce drop-off rates.
